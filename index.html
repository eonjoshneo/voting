<h3><u>Significance Of Voting</u></h3>

  - Voting is considered as a significant event that can change our future in a county, economy, society, and even more. It is your voice that commands change. It is also your fundamental right, and an essential part to being an active citizen. 

Here are some reasons why voting is significant, and should be practiced. 

 <ol>Voice In Voting:

 
  <li>- Your voices give an opportunity to open up opinions, and thoughts, and to also choose your representatives of choice. By voting, you have a chance to choose representatives, and leaders who share the views, and values with you, and you are sure that will make correct decisions that help our country. </li> </ol>

 <ol>Reflecting The Will Of People:


 <li>- By voting, we are able to showcase our free will off. Because voting is essentially choosing your own leader, and representative without being pressured, forced, or unwilling. It shows that you are confident in your choice. Your vote can encourage others as well to start voting their own choice of representatives, and leader, which can cause a chain reaction to their side of the family, friends, or even community. </li> </ol>

 <ol>Effect On Everyday Life:

 
 <li>- Resources on public schools, health insurance, security of country, public transport issues, and erros. All of this listed issues are all decided by the leaders that have been voted by past years. Because of their decisions, our everyday lives will be effected by them. Voting the right leaders, or the leaders you believe will do good, means you care about issues to vote the right person.</li>  </ol>

 <ol>Every Vote Counts:


 <li>- There have been many cases where voting comes very close. One example is an election in America where a candidate won by only a 300 vote difference. This one example just shows how important one vote can even be, and we, as a nation should vote as this can change our system, and our politicians who we believe are doing wrong. </li> </ol>

  <ol>For The Future Of Younger Generations:


<li>- We, today's society have suffered enough from the  bias of the government. We have suffered from corruption, false promises, incompetent leaders that have been given a position. By voting, we are giving the younger generation a chance for a society that is better, than we have experienced. </li>

 </ol>

<h3><u>HOW TO AVOID ELECTION MISINFORMATION AND PROPAGANDA</u> </h3>
<ul>Be Careful with What You Believe and Share Online
Social media is full of false information, tricks, and edited photos or videos meant to fool people. Many of these are made to change how people think, especially about elections.</ul>  

Our page will help you avoid falling for false information so you can choose the best leader for a better future.  
 
How False Information Spreads
<ol>
Today, any news big or small can spread fast. It happens like this:  
<li>Someone posts something online.  </li>
<li>Their followers share it on their own pages.  </li>
<li>More people talk about it, making it seem important, even if it’s not true.  </li>
</ol>

This cycle keeps going, making lies spread quickly. While you can’t stop it, you can avoid adding to the problem.  </p>

<ul>How to Protect Yourself
<li>The best way to stay safe from false information is to think before you share. If a post makes you angry or strongly agrees with what you already believe, stop and check if it’s true first. Scammers and fake news creators know how to trick people by telling them what they want to hear. </li></ul> 

<p>Also, be aware that news companies need to make money. They try to be accurate, but many focus on stories that their audience wants to hear, which can make them biased.  </p>

<p>Be Careful with Emotional Stories
Stories that make you feel strong emotions
like hope, fear, or anger can be powerful. They can inspire people to vote, but they can also be used to mislead them. Instead of believing them right away, take a step back and think. </p> 

<p>Before you vote, make sure your decision is based on facts, not just feelings.</p>

<p>
	<h3><u>Characteristics Of A Responsible Voter</u></h3>

-Responsible voters usually take the elector very usually as they know it affects them as well. So let us look into some of the characteristics of a responsible voter.

 <ol>Engaged:

 <ol>Critical Thinking:

  </ol>

  <h3><u>You're the voice: it's our responsibility to vote wisely </u></h3>



<ul>Not every choice is made equally.  Some have insignificant repercussions.  Some are more important, such as if you choose to put your profession before seeing the entire world.  These choices, however, still only have an effect on your life and are unlikely to have an effect on others.</ul>

<h4><u>Tips on how to vote wisely</u></h4>s
<li>#1- Know everything about each candidate 
Whether they are running for national or local position, it’s very important that we know everything about each candidate. Spend time learning about the backgrounds of other candidates as well as their specific plans for the nation when they are elected, rather than concentrating just on one.</li>

<li>#2- Listen with an open mind
Politicians invest money just to learn public speaking and how to deal with different kinds of voters. Like salespeople, they are attractive and have a lovely voice.  Therefore, be wary of their good intentions, particularly if they seem too good to be true.  Rather, pay attention to them with an open mind.  Sometimes, wise politicians use language that is not to be taken literally.</li>

 <li>#3- Never vote based on popularity
Unfortunately, this is a big issue for those who are too lazy or lack the time to research each candidate in depth.  Indeed, wealthy candidates are exploiting this voter weakness.  A lot of politicians come from show business, so keep in mind that they are also actors.</li>

<li>#4- Don’t just join the majority vote
Many politicians tend to ask support from big groups so they can instantly get majority votes. The issue is that you are denying yourself the freedom to make your own decisions.  It's perfectly acceptable to listen to suggestions, but don't support a candidate just because you think a lot of people would support him.  Simply said, don't let anyone tell you what to do.</li>

<li>#5- Vote what our country needs, not who you need Politicians pretend that they genuinely care about the underprivileged.  Actually, many of them conduct favors for wealthy businessmen or donate items and cash to low-income families.  If you truly need their presents, it's acceptable to take them, but it doesn't imply you should vote for them.  This "utang na loob" mentality must end, and we must finally vote for what our nation truly needs.</li></ol>
